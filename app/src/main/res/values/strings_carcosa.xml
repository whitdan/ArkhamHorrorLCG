    <!-- Campaign introduction-->
    <string name="carcosa_introduction"><b>Prologue</b>\n
    \nYou turn over the folded program in your hand, reading it for what seems like the hundredth time. “Miskatonic
        Playhouse presents: <i>The King in Yellow</i>,” it reads. “A special one-night engagement at Arkham’s very own Ward
        Theatre. An irresistible drama in two acts. Production staged and directed by Nigel Engram.” The cast is a
        small ensemble, with one unattributed credit at the end: “The Stranger.”\n
    \nTo have such a highly anticipated play come to Arkham all the way from Paris is a noteworthy event, even if it
        is just for one night. For weeks leading up to the show, it was the talk of the town. It seemed so
        unassuming…and yet, you have evidence something sinister is at work. It started with the disappearance of one
        of the stagehands at the theatre—a boy of only seventeen who missed rehearsal one night and was never seen
        again. Then, less than two weeks before the performance, there was the musician whose corpse was found with a
        gun in its mouth. Perhaps most chilling was the crazed man the coppers had picked up in Independence Square
        who had been ranting and raving about the “King’s return.” He was brought to Arkham Asylum, and you were
        surprised to discover that he was not alone in his delusions.\n
    \nFinding these events suspicious, you and your companions have delved deeper into the matter. Although no
        connection can be proven, these weren’t the only strange events surrounding the up-and-coming play. Instances
        of suicide and madness have followed in its wake, and you are determined to discover why.\n
    \nThe lights in the auditorium dim, and a spotlight shines on the stage. What unfolds is not quite what you
        expected. Slow-paced and monotonous, the first act of <i>The King in Yellow</i> is a tedious bore. The setting and
        characters are compelling, but the meandering and nonsensical story does little to entertain or inform. You
        begin to wonder whether the dreadful events surrounding <i>The King in Yellow</i> aren’t connected, after all.
        Perhaps it was just your overactive imagination; how could such a trivial and unassuming show cause such
        pandemonium? You are surprised when the first act closes without any rising action or revelation. The lights
        rise for the intermission, and you consider leaving early, stifling a yawn. Before you are able to decide,
        however, you find yourself drifting…drifting…to sleep.</string>

    <string name="carcosa_lola_prologue">Act I came and went without a hitch, as it often did in rehearsal. You
        couldn’t help but note the blank, dismissive expressions on many of the audience members’ faces, and you
        wonder how the audience will react to the play’s disturbing second half. The role of Cassilda is tiresomely
        boring for the first half of the play, although you enjoy portraying her regal charm. You find yourself
        missing your previous co-star, Miriam Twain, and suddenly the dread and regret you had felt in Paris comes
        flooding back. With a sigh, you retreat to a dark corner backstage to escape the sounds of stagehands
        preparing for the next scene. You try to quell your emotions and replace your thoughts with those of
        Cassilda’s—her hopes, her fears, her fate.\n
    \nJust then, you catch the Stranger staring at you from afar, and you find yourself shaking at the mere sight of
        him. Even though they continue to replace the actor who plays the Stranger before each show (and indeed many
        times during rehearsals), you know that this last-minute replacement is the most horrid of them all.
        Realizing you never caught his name, a shiver of terror courses through your spine. Have you found your way
        back to the wolves, like a lost lamb? You cannot look away—his gaze is inescapable. Everything goes black
        .</string>


    <!--Scenario introductions-->
    <string name="curtain_introduction">You awaken with a start, as though shaken by an unseen force. You must have
        slept for quite some time, for there are only a few other patrons in the audience, and no performers on
        stage. The lights are dimmed, and the stage curtains are tattered and ripped, though you do not remember that
        being the case during the first act. You wait a moment before you are sure this isn’t part of the
        performance. As you wait, a foul but unrecognizable smell permeates the air. How long have you been asleep?
        Shaking off your drowsiness, you walk toward one of the seated patrons and ask for the time, but he does not
        respond. It is then that you realize you are speaking to a corpse.</string>

    <string name="king_introduction">If anyone has the answers to the questions that burn in your mind, it’s the cast
        and crew of <i>The King in Yellow</i>. With no other leads to pursue, you put on your best clothes and head to 1452
        Atlantic Avenue, where a woman named Constance Dumaine is hosting an event in celebration of the play’s
        one-night engagement in Arkham.</string>

    <string name="carcosa_interlude_one_option_one">Things seem to have calmed down. Perhaps we should go back inside
        and investigate further.</string>
    <string name="carcosa_interlude_one_option_two">I don’t trust this place one bit. Let’s block the door and get
        the hell out of here!</string>
    <string name="carcosa_interlude_one_option_three">If these people are allowed to live, these horrors will only
        repeat themselves. We have to put an end to this. We have to <i>kill them</i>.</string>
    <string name="carcosa_interlude_one_one">The change in the atmosphere has you curious. What if it was all a trick
        of your mind? What if the hauntings that follow <i>The King in Yellow</i> are but transitory? The answers to
        all of your questions might lie inside. Cautiously, you open the front door to the manor once again.
        Reassuring jazz and the clamor of casual conversation grow louder as you step inside. The enticing smell of
        roasted pork wafts through the air. As you suspected, the signs of struggle and oddities you noticed before
        have vanished without explanation. Then, as you turn the corner into the dining room, you find the Stranger
        speaking with another man—tall, mustached, wearing a fine black suit, and holding a silver-handled cane. The
        Stranger turns to you, his gaze drills through your mind, and your vision swims with agony. Before you
        realize it, you are running as fast as you can, toppling through the front doorway in a haze of pain and
        disorientation. Without time to catch your breath, you race to your vehicle and speed away, hands trembling
        upon the steering wheel.\n
    \n<b>Why would you go back inside?</b>\n
    \n<b>Remove all Cultist, Tablet, and Elder tokens from the chaos bag. Then, add 2 Elder Thing tokens to the chaos
            bag.</b></string>
    <string name="carcosa_interlude_one_two">You can’t trust your senses. This is all a trick, an attempt to lure you
        back inside. You’re no safer now than you were before. Swallowing your fear, you set to work barricading the
        front door of the manor using several of the heavy stone benches lining the cobblestone path in the front
        yard. You hope it’s enough, but you aren’t willing to stick around to find out. As soon as you’re done, you
        head back to your vehicle and drive toward Southside, where you hope to find answers.\n
    \n<b>That door isn’t going to stop them.</b>\n
    \n<b>Remove all Cultist, Tablet, and Elder tokens from the chaos bag. Then, add 2 Tablet tokens to the chaos
            bag.</b></string>
    <string name="carcosa_interlude_one_three">You dare not risk stepping back inside that madhouse. But you can’t
        let the monstrosities run amok, either. You root through the open garage for a few supplies, finding an old
        hose, an empty gasoline canister, and some matches. Knowing what you must do, you first siphon some gas from
        Mrs. Dumaine’s Oakland 6-54A. You spread the gasoline across the front porch, inside the garage, and around
        the manor’s outer walls. From there, all it takes is several matches to start the blaze. You watch from the
        front yard as the manor is eventually consumed by the flames. The sounds of crackling fire and snapping wood
        and the screeching of dying horrors fills the street. Satisfied, you head back to your vehicle and tear off
        toward Southside, full of grim determination.\n
    \n<b>You did what had to be done… Right?</b>\n
    \n<b>Remove all Cultist, Tablet, and Elder tokens from the chaos bag. Then, add 2 Cultist tokens to the chaos
            bag.</b></string>

    <string name="echoes_introduction">Your head throbs with a dull ache as you drive through the rainy streets of
        Arkham toward your next destination. The threat of the Stranger looms in your mind, and you find yourself
        glancing often at your rear-view mirror, expecting to see the expressionless visage of his mask haunting you.
        Instead, you see nothing but the misty, starless night, and the deserted road behind you.\n
    \nYour thoughts once again wander, as they have often in the past few hours, to <i>The King in Yellow</i> and to
        the city of Carcosa and its inhabitants. What was the message hidden inside that awful play, the meaning
        within its madness? A lone detail worms its way to the forefront of your thoughts, one made apparent by the
        discussions you’d overheard at Ms. Dumaine’s estate—that tonight’s performance of <i>The King in Yellow</i>
        was not the first Arkham had seen of the foul play. There had been at least one other performance, directed
        by the same man: Nigel Engram.\n
    \nThere is one place in Arkham where records are often kept of important events occurring within the city: the
        Historical Society’s manor house in Southside. If there are any records of the previous show of <i>The King
            in Yellow</i>, the Historical Society may have held onto them. Perhaps there you will find answers to the
        questions that burn in your mind.</string>

    \nYou recall what Sebastien told you during the dinner party. <i>The King in Yellow</i> had come to Arkham
        several decades ago, long before the Ward Theatre was built. According to him, it isn’t surprising that few
        people remember—in fact, part of their goal tonight was to bring <i>The King in Yellow</i> to a wider
        audience. The Historical Society may have kept records pertaining to this earlier production, especially if
        it was followed by events similar to what has occurred tonight. Perhaps you can find some newspaper clippings
        or other articles describing what happened in the past.</string>

    <!--Scenario resolutions-->
    <string name="curtain_no_resolution">Once again you are startled awake, this time by the cold, clammy fingers of
        a hand on your shoulder. “Are you alright?” an elderly man asks, helping you to your feet. Your mind is a
        flurry of memories. Last you remember, the Ward Theatre had become a place of nightmares, filled with
        dangerous fanatics and strange terrors. Worried, you glance at your surroundings, only to find yourself on
        the rain-slicked curb outside the theatre. Despite the events from earlier, the city seems normal to your
        eyes—or at least, what passes as normal for Arkham. The bright glare of headlights drills into your eyes as
        cars pass on the street, splashing dirty rainwater onto the sidewalk beside you. The old man wears an
        expression of concern, noting the terror in your eyes. “Were you mugged? Damn those trouble boys!” he
        exclaims. “Dry-gulching folk on a night out to the the-a-tre! Not a single street those hooligans haven’t
        staked a claim on, I tell you.”\n
    \nYou stand and walk over to the front window of the Ward Theatre to tentatively peer through, but it is too dark
        to see anything inside. The elderly man eyes you curiously for a moment, then shrugs and continues walking.
        “Well, I’d best be on my way. I would do the same, if I were you,” he says, rounding the street corner. You
        quickly follow, hoping to warn him to stay away from the theatre. But when you turn the corner, it is not the
        elderly man you see, but the familiar sight of the Stranger in his featureless, pallid mask. His unwavering
        gaze bears down upon you. “Who are you?” you call out. The Stranger does not respond, but instead turns and
        disappears into the alleyway behind the theatre. You give chase, hoping for answers, but by the time you
        reach the alleyway, it is empty—save for a notice on the wall near the theatre’s employee entrance. “Don’t be
        a wet blanket! Come to <i>The King in Yellow</i> cast party. 8pm, at the home of Constance Dumaine, 1452 Atlantic
        Avenue. Formal dress only.” You tear the notice from the wall and take it with you, frustrated and lost
        .\n
    \n<b>Add The Man in the Pallid Mask weakness to the lead investigator’s deck (does not count towards deck size).
            For the remainder of this campaign, any time the bearer of The Man in the Pallid Mask leaves the campaign

    <string name="curtain_resolution_one">Fleeing from the theatre, you head straight to the police station in
        Easttown. Bursting through the door, to the stares of onlookers and police officers alike, you demand to see
        Sheriff Engle, stressing the importance of your visit. The desk sergeant, who is lazily working through a
        stack of paperwork, shakes his head and raises a finger in silence, then points to a nearby chair. The wait
        is excruciating. Every moment is an eternity. The hands of the nearby clock crawl. You drum your fingers on
        the desk. You tap your feet. You constantly peer over your shoulder to make sure the pallid mask of the
        Stranger is not watching you through the front window. Finally, the desk sergeant puts his pen down and sits
        up, beckoning you. “Alright, what’s so important now?” You are only halfway through your explanation of the
        night’s events when he sighs and shakes his head. “Look, if this is some kind of joke, it ain’t funny,” he
        says. “We had officers downtown all night. Don’t try to feed me some hooey straight to my face.” You insist,
        but the desk sergeant rises to his feet and opens the door, motioning for you to leave. He raises his voice.
        “What, you think we’re not busy enough or something? Beat it!” He mumbles about “blind birds” behind your
        back as he escorts you out of the station.\n
    \nYou <b>know</b> what you saw earlier that night. Frustrated, you head back to the Ward Theatre to find some
        kind of proof you can take to the police. You are surprised to find that the front door of the theatre is
        locked. You are about to decide whether or not to break down the door when you see a notice on the wall near
        the entrance. “Don’t be a wet blanket! Come to <i>The King in Yellow</i> cast party. 8pm, at the home of Constance
        Dumaine, 1452 Atlantic Avenue. Formal dress only.” You tear the notice from the wall and fold it into your
        coat pocket, hoping it will lead you to the answers you seek.\n

    <string name="curtain_resolution_two">You think about going to the police, but considering the horrors in the
        theatre, they’re more likely to think you’re mad than to believe your story. A small part of you wonders if
        this is still some kind of prank, but that can’t be the case—it was all too real, too terrifying to forget.
        Wondering what course of action to take, you find yourself backtracking over your escape route, returning to
        the theatre with cautious steps. The bright glare of headlights drills into your eyes as cars pass on the
        street, splashing dirty rainwater onto the sidewalk beside you. Soon the Ward Theatre comes into sight, its
        bright lights dominating the streets of Downtown. You expected the theatre to be in ruins, but its exterior
        looks the same as it did when you arrived to see <i>The King in Yellow</i> earlier that night. You walk to the front
        window of the Ward Theatre and tentatively peer through, but it is too dark to see anything inside.\n
    \nJust then, a chill brushes the nape of your neck, and you feel that you are being watched. You turn, and spot a
        shadow fleeing around the corner. A swarm of roaches skitters across the sidewalk, following in the shadow’s
        wake. Your muscles tense with uncertainty, and you round the corner in pursuit. Standing unconcerned on the
        sidewalk is a familiar-looking man in a featureless pallid mask.\n
    \nHis unwavering gaze bears down upon you. “Who are you?” you call out. The Stranger does not respond, and
        instead turns and disappears into the alleyway behind the theatre. You give chase, hoping for answers, but by
        the time you reach the alleyway, it is empty—save for a notice on the wall near the theatre’s employee
        entrance. “Don’t be a wet blanket! Come to <i>The King in Yellow</i> cast party. 8pm, at the home of Constance
        Dumaine, 1452 Atlantic Avenue. Formal dress only.” You tear the notice from the wall and take it with you,
        hoping it will lead you to the answers you seek.\n

    <string name="king_resolution_one">The brisk autumn air embraces you as you exit the manor. There is no doubt in
        your mind that the cast and crew of <i>The King in Yellow</i> have become affected by madness. Perhaps it’s getting
        to you, as well. You feel an encroaching darkness, a presence in your mind not unlike the gaze of the
        Stranger. Startled, you peer about the front yard for the first time since escaping the manor. The scene
        is…different. The front windows are not smashed as they were when you first approached. The trail of blood
        you had noticed on the porch has been wiped clean, and instead of the disturbingly warped music you had heard
        upon entering, the soothing tones of slow jazz drift out from the courtyard.\n

    <string name="king_resolution_two">“Excuse me, but it’s very late,” you hear a server say as he gently taps you
        on your shoulder. You realize that you are sitting on a couch in the manor’s living room, and that you have
        been asleep for some time. The party appears to be winding down. No music fills the halls, the food is all
        but gone, and only a few guests remain. “Perhaps you would like for me to get your coat?” the server asks
        with a trained smile. You wobble as you rise to your feet, leaning against the couch’s armrest. Your head
        pounds with a dizzying intensity, and your vision is spotted. You insist that you are fine, and begin walking
        toward the foyer.\n
    \nYou no longer see any of the guests you were searching for earlier, not even the hostess, Mrs. Dumaine. All
        traces of the madness and horror you’ve experienced are gone. Even the oddities you witnessed upon entering
        the manor have vanished—the signs of struggle, the broken windows, the blood trail on the porch… Every piece
        of evidence has been erased. But you still remember the night’s events, and in your memory you will find your
        answers.\n

    <string name="king_resolution_three">Several days later, you find yourself reminiscing about the party you
        attended at 1452 Atlantic Avenue. What a roaring good time you had! And yet, your memory is hazy. You can’t
        help but feel you are forgetting something important. Something about the play you’d watched earlier that
        night—<i>The King in Yellow</i>. That nagging sensation pursues you in every waking moment. Try as you might to
        recall the night’s events in full, there remains a gaping hole in your memory. As you strain to remember,
        your concern grows, almost to the point of obsession. Deciding that you absolutely must know what occurred
        that night, you head toward the manor of the Historical Society in Southside. Perhaps there you can learn
        more about <i>The King in Yellow</i> play…\n
